# McOfee_Simulation
This demo is mainly related to C++ and Python binding using SWIG. This simulates a computer being infected (C++) and a shell which allows
a user to defend himself by getting rid of threats from the computer(Python).
<br/><br/>
The purpose of this demo is also to use different C++ concepts in order to check wheter these are properly managed by SWIG:<br/>
_ Template function<br/>
_ Virtual functions<br/>
_ Inheritance<br/>
_ Overloaded operators<br/>
_ Multi-threading<br/>
_ Using external libraries such as Boost<br/>
_ Pure virtual functions<br/>
_ Static variables (class)<br/>
<br/><br/>
This project simulates a computer being infected. A main class Computer will act as the local computer, receive threats generated by the ThreatsSimulator. The main simulation class will manage all of the components, including the MySQL connection, and will be the main gap between C++ and Python, using SWIG.

The Python side will be a custom Python shell, which will allow the user to perform several actions such as list the current threats, remove, placing in quarantine or even rename a threat.


<b>To install and run:</b><br/>
This demo runs on GNU/Linux Ubuntu 16.04LTS and requires the MySQL/Boost and SWIG libraries.<br/><br/>

The UML directory contains UML classes and sequence diagrams that can be opened with UMLet for GNU/Linux.
And the Doxygen directory contains all of the files for the documentation of the project (JavaDoc) like.
